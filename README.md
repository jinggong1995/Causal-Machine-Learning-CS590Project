# CS590 Project: Optimization Under Fairness Constrains

This project addresses the problem of unfairness decision making process in machine learning algorithms. In the near functure, machine learning systems will be driving entire industry decisions and, more broadly, supporting large-scale decision-making process to solve society’s most challenging problems. Issues of unfairness and discrimination are pervasive when decisions
are being made by humans, which, unfortunately, are not automatically solved, when machines are put in control. 

Hence, this project chanllenges to eliminate the unfairness or discrimination in real decision making industry with machine learing tools. I adopt the causal effect measurements from the paper: Fairness in Decision-Making – The Causal Explanation Formula(which can be found here: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/eb/r30.pdf). It is the first time that the measurements are considered as constrains and optimal decisions are reached based on the constrains over both discrete and continuous domain, and also different kinds of utility functions. 

In addition, the application of this project broadly ranges in bioinformatics, economics, medicine, and public health.
